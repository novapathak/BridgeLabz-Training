- Implemented **10 file I/O operations** including file copy, serialization, image byte conversion, and inter-thread communication
- Used **byte streams (FileInputStream, FileOutputStream), character streams (FileReader, FileWriter), buffered streams, data streams, object streams, and piped streams**
- Applied **efficient techniques** for large files (buffering, chunking, line-by-line reading) and performance optimization
- Built **data processing tools** for case conversion, word counting, and filtering error logs
- Strengthened **exception handling and resource management** with try-with-resources and proper stream closing
