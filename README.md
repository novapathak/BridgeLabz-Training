## 📘 About This Repository

#### This repository documents my day-wise learning progress in Git, GitHub, and Java Object Oriented concepts. It includes structured practice programs, concept-wise code organization, and daily summaries of topics covered

## Day 9 – Object Oriented concept overview and classes and objects
 Date -26-12-2025

## ✅ Overview
- Transitioned from procedural to object-oriented programming (OOP) mindset
- Learned to model real-world entities using classes and objects
- Understood key advantages of OOP: encapsulation, modularity, and reusability
- Practiced through structured examples and problem-solving

## 📘 Concepts Covered
- **Classes & Objects**: Blueprints vs instances, memory allocation
- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with public getters/setters
- **Constructors**: Object initialization techniques
- **Methods**: Defining object behaviors and operations
- **OOP Principles**: Modularity, data security, real-world modeling

## 🧪 Hands-on Practice
**Level 1 Programs:**
- Employee, Circle, Book, Inventory, and MobilePhone classes

**Level 2 Programs:**
- Student grade system, ATM simulator, Palindrome checker
- Movie ticket booking, Shopping cart simulation

## Day 10 – Java Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables and Access Modifiers
Date -27-12-2025

## ✅ Overview
- Learned constructor types (default, parameterized, copy) and their applications
- Understood access modifiers (public, protected, private, package) for encapsulation
- Differentiated between instance variables (object-specific) and class variables (shared)
- Applied these concepts through real-world system implementations

## 📘 Concepts Covered
- **Constructor Types**: Default, parameterized, copy constructors, and constructor chaining
- **Access Modifiers**: public, protected, private, and package-private visibility rules
- **Instance vs Class Variables**: Per-object data vs shared static data
- **Encapsulation Principles**: Private attributes with controlled access methods
- **Constructor Best Practices**: Using `this`, keeping logic simple, constructor overloading

## 🧪 Hands-on Practice
**Constructor Programs:**
- CoffeeShopOrder system with multiple constructor types
- Book, Circle, and Person classes with various constructors
- Hotel Booking System with booking management
- Library Book System with borrowing functionality
- Car Rental System with cost calculation

**Instance vs Class Variables:**
- School class tracking student count with static variable
- Product Inventory with shared product counter
- Online Course Management with common institute name
- Vehicle Registration with fixed fee for all vehicles

**Access Modifiers:**
- University Management System with Student subclass
- Book Library System with EBook subclass
- Bank Account Management with SavingsAccount subclass
- Employee Records with Manager subclass
