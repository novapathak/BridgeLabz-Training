## 📅 Week 3: Data Structures and Algorithms

---

 ## Day 15 - LinkedList
 Date -02-01-2026

 ## ✅ Overview
- Learned linked lists as fundamental linear data structures for dynamic memory management
- Understood differences between singly, doubly, and circular linked list implementations
- Mastered operations (insertion, deletion, traversal) for each linked list type
- Applied linked lists to solve real-world data management problems

## 📘 Concepts Covered
- **Singly Linked Lists**: Forward-only traversal with single next pointers
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: Bidirectional traversal with next and previous pointers
- **Circular Linked Lists**: Cyclic structures without null endpoints
- **Core Operations**: Insertion (beginning, end, position), deletion, search, traversal
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic allocation, pointer manipulation, edge case handling
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for head/tail operations, O(n) for positional operations

## 🧪 Hands-on Practice
**Basic Implementations:**
- Employee Record Management using singly linked lists
- Music Playlist Management using circular linked lists
- Node structure implementation for all three linked list types

**Complex Systems Built:**
- Student Record Management System (Singly Linked List)
- Movie Management System (Doubly Linked List)
- Task Scheduler (Circular Linked List)
- Inventory Management System (Singly Linked List)
- Library Management System (Doubly Linked List)
- Round Robin CPU Scheduling (Circular Linked List)
- Social Media Friend Connections (Singly Linked List)
- Undo/Redo Text Editor (Doubly Linked List)
- Online Ticket Reservation (Circular Linked List)

## Day 16 - Stacks, Queues, Hash Maps and Hash Functions
Date -03-01-2026

## ✅ Overview
- Learned core linear data structures: Stacks (LIFO) and Queues (FIFO)
- Mastered HashMap for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval
- Understood hashing functions and collision handling techniques
- Applied these structures to solve real-world computational problems

## 📘 Concepts Covered
- **Stacks**: LIFO principle, push/pop/peek operations, balanced parentheses validation, call stack management
- **Queues**: FIFO principle, enqueue/dequeue operations, types (simple, priority, deque), ticket counter simulation
- **HashMaps**: Key-value storage, hash functions, bucket management, collision resolution (separate chaining)
- **Hashing**: Hash code computation, equals() and hashCode() overriding, collision minimization
- **Performance**: Time/space complexity analysis for each data structure

## 🧪 Hands-on Practice
**Stack Implementations:**
- Balanced Parentheses Checker using stack validation
- Expression evaluation and syntax checking
- Undo/redo functionality simulation

**Queue Implementations:**
- Ticket counter management system
- Task scheduling with FIFO processing
- Breadth-first search algorithms

**HashMap Implementations:**
- Word frequency counter
- Custom Employee class with hashCode() and equals() overrides
- Efficient data lookup systems

**Advanced Problems:**
- Implement queue using two stacks
- Sort stack using recursion
- Stock span problem with stack optimization
- Sliding window maximum using deque
- Find zero-sum subarrays using hash maps
- Longest consecutive sequence detection
- Custom HashMap implementation with collision handling
