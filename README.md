 ## Day 15 - LinkedList
 Date -02-01-2026

 ## ✅ Overview
- Learned linked lists as fundamental linear data structures for dynamic memory management
- Understood differences between singly, doubly, and circular linked list implementations
- Mastered operations (insertion, deletion, traversal) for each linked list type
- Applied linked lists to solve real-world data management problems

## 📘 Concepts Covered
- **Singly Linked Lists**: Forward-only traversal with single next pointers
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: Bidirectional traversal with next and previous pointers
- **Circular Linked Lists**: Cyclic structures without null endpoints
- **Core Operations**: Insertion (beginning, end, position), deletion, search, traversal
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic allocation, pointer manipulation, edge case handling
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for head/tail operations, O(n) for positional operations

## 🧪 Hands-on Practice
**Basic Implementations:**
- Employee Record Management using singly linked lists
- Music Playlist Management using circular linked lists
- Node structure implementation for all three linked list types

**Complex Systems Built:**
- Student Record Management System (Singly Linked List)
- Movie Management System (Doubly Linked List)
- Task Scheduler (Circular Linked List)
- Inventory Management System (Singly Linked List)
- Library Management System (Doubly Linked List)
- Round Robin CPU Scheduling (Circular Linked List)
- Social Media Friend Connections (Singly Linked List)
- Undo/Redo Text Editor (Doubly Linked List)
- Online Ticket Reservation (Circular Linked List)
