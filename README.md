## 📘 About This Repository

#### This repository documents my day-wise learning progress in Git, GitHub, and Java Object Oriented concepts. It includes structured practice programs, concept-wise code organization, and daily summaries of topics covered

## Day 9 – Object Oriented concept overview and classes and objects
 Date -26-12-2025

## ✅ Overview
- Transitioned from procedural to object-oriented programming (OOP) mindset
- Learned to model real-world entities using classes and objects
- Understood key advantages of OOP: encapsulation, modularity, and reusability
- Practiced through structured examples and problem-solving

## 📘 Concepts Covered
- **Classes & Objects**: Blueprints vs instances, memory allocation
- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with public getters/setters
- **Constructors**: Object initialization techniques
- **Methods**: Defining object behaviors and operations
- **OOP Principles**: Modularity, data security, real-world modeling

## 🧪 Hands-on Practice
**Level 1 Programs:**
- Employee, Circle, Book, Inventory, and MobilePhone classes

**Level 2 Programs:**
- Student grade system, ATM simulator, Palindrome checker
- Movie ticket booking, Shopping cart simulation
